# Contacts
In this project, I wrote a program that enables creating contacts (like on the mobile phone) and search for people or organizations by name.

While writing the project, I came across the following topics:

Learnt: Factory Methods, Builder, Abstract classes
Practicing: IO, Serialization, OOP, Polymorphism, Inheritance
